**Patrick** *0:00:00* <br/>Some explanations around the effects of [shareholder capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shareholder_capitalism) and the idea that this mechanism indeed has consequences with respect to the incentives of organizations and their long-term fates hold credibility. It's plausible that shareholder capitalism even attenuates the duration of some of these organizations. While this isn't definitively true, the idea is intriguing. <br/>However, even if it is true, it's not necessarily bad. The question arises: are we on the side of the humans, the aggregate innovation in the world, or the corporations as [legal entities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_person)? It's unclear whether the answer should favor the latter. <br/>This perspective may be consistent with observations in other regions, such as [Europe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europe) or [Denmark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denmark).<br/>**Patrick** *0:01:01* <br/>Reasons related to the [tax code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_code) result in many organizations being either controlled by or substantially held by [nonprofit foundations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_(nonprofit)). For instance, [Novo Nordisk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novo_Nordisk), the GLP company, [Mersk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maersk), the shipping company, and even [Lego](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego). These corporations are typically controlled by foundations that hold a significant amount of their stock. <br/>This often has a secondary effect where they legally embed their mission into their constitution. While I'm not an expert on Novo Nordisk, I recently read a book about it. It's enshrined in their constitution that they must make insulin widely available at a low cost, at least in Scandinavian countries. They are permitted to charge market prices elsewhere. Furthermore, they are legally obligated to reinvest the rest of their profits in [R&D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_and_development). <br/>Could this be a factor in their invention of one of the most remarkable pharmacological discoveries of the last 20 years in these GLP one agonists? It's plausible. The questions surrounding why the median age of organizations and corporations is what it is, are certainly intriguing. It's likely a somewhat contingent aspect of how we've chosen to organize large corporations in the [US](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) today.<br/>**Dwarkesh** *0:02:43* <br/>The point you're making about this firm appears very similar to the [export-led growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export-led_growth) in Asia. Are there [tariffs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff) involved? This particular company is responsible for [car production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automotive_industry), and it's crucial that they manufacture high-quality vehicles.<br/>**Patrick** *0:02:54* <br/>You have no competition, but you had to invent the best car in the mean. We are all fans of [Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith), [Ricardo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ricardo), and all these characters. Even they are less dogmatically attached to free trade than people today interpret them as being. People like [Friedrich List](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_List) and those other not quite contemporaries, but quasi contemporaries are, on a relative basis, underrated. <br/>In as much as you believe the sociological, cultural skill, or even vague alignment, not in the [AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) sense, but in the more interpersonal sense, these are important and explanatory. Then, you end up thinking about some of the things you just raised.<br/>**Dwarkesh** *0:03:43* <br/>It's really interesting to hear you say that. When considering [Stripe's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stripe_(company)) mission, it's to facilitate global trade. It ensures that a firm from [India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India) can compete with any firm in [Nigeria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigeria) or elsewhere. Therefore, the room for a learning curve, where you're less efficient than the global competition, should be minimized if Stripe exists. Isn't Stripe the antithesis of a list company?<br/>**Patrick** *0:04:06* <br/>It depends on the version of the list. To clarify, I'm not endorsing these [tariffs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tariff) and [trade barriers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_barrier). The history associated with them is checkered at best. <br/>It's possible that if a specific sector has clear goals and a credible path to substantial success, along with some more conjoined propositions, then some degree of activist trade policy might be beneficial. However, this doesn't describe most sectors in most countries, most of the time.<br/>
